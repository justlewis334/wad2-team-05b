		<h3 align="center">How to Make a Dadaist Poem</h3>
		<p >
		To make a Dadaist poem:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Take a newspaper.
		<li>Take a pair of scissors.
		<li>Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.
		<li>Cut out the article.
		<li>Then cut out each of the words that make up this article
		and put them in a bag.
		<li>Shake it gently.
		<li>Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order
		in which they left the bag.
		<li>Copy conscientiously.
		<li>The poem will be like you.
		<li>And here are you a writer, infinitely original and endowed
		with a sensibility that is charming though beyond the
		understanding of the vulgar.

		</ul>
